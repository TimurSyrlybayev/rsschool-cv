**Summary:** Hi! My name is Timur, I'm living in Almaty (Kazakhstan). After spending 14 years as an economist in a banking sphere and about 5 years as a psychologist at the same time (received my second degree in 2012), I realized that I want to change my life completely. Becoming a software developer and working with information technologies was my childhood dream, but somewhere on my way I took a wrong turn :) Now I'm trying to fix this mistake and become a true developer. My goal is to gain new qualification, get a relative job, obtain new experience and become a real professional in developing. I'm really passionate about studying new IT staff. Android development is what I want to tie my life with, but I'm also looking forward impatiently to new courses and knowledges. And in addition I highly desire to watch new cities and countries and to live in them, so I gladly will consider any possibility to work abroad.
